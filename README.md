# autoCloseApp
autoCloseApp closes the latest program opened on MacOSX on a timer (in hours). This is a small program I created to close out of my web browser automatically if I decide to leave a video running before I sleep.

# Limits
You can only use integers as input.

# Running
'''
cd autoCloseApp
pip install keyboard
python app.py
